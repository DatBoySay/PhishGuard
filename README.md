# PhishGuard 🛡️

**PhishGuard** is a simple AI + Cybersecurity demo app that detects phishing attempts in emails and URLs.  
It combines machine learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) with classic security heuristics to score messages and highlight red flags.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Paste an email or URL → get a phishing **risk score** (0–100%).
- Highlights **why** something is suspicious:
  - Suspicious TLDs (.zip, .xyz, etc.)
  - IP addresses in URLs
  - Urgency / scare language
  - Requests for sensitive info
- Tiny ML model trained on phishing vs. safe samples.
- Runs entirely locally (no external APIs).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Flask (web app)  
- scikit-learn (ML model)  
- BeautifulSoup4 + tldextract (security parsing)
